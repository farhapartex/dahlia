### What is Dahlia
Dahlia is a blog cms, developed based on Django Framework. The main philosophy of `Dahlia` is `no back-end, only front-end`. The purpose is, if user want to host his/her own blog site, they just need to install the cms, and integrate APIs with front-end. It doesn't matter how the front-end will be developed.
